## Manage Landing Page

This landing page has been built using the popular CSS framework, Tailwind. If you're unfamiliar with Tailwind, it is a utility-first CSS framework that gives you the power to build custom designs without the need for writing custom CSS.

To get started with your landing page, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
  npm install tailwindcss
```
Next, you'll need to create a configuration file for Tailwind. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
  npx tailwindcss init
```
This will create a tailwind.config.js file in your project directory. You can then customize your Tailwind configuration by modifying this file.

Once you have your dependencies installed and your configuration file set up, you can start building your landing page. You can do this by adding the necessary HTML markup to your HTML file, and then applying the relevant Tailwind classes to your elements.

Here's an example of how you might use Tailwind to style a simple button:

```bash
  <button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Button
  </button>
```

For more information on how to use Tailwind, be sure to check out the official documentation.
